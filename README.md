todo-learning-playground
========================

A playground repository to use as a playground for learning git, GitHub, HTML/CSS, Javascript, PHP, and... well you get it.

Here are some horrible typos. Fix them!

While you're at it, add these new/blank files to the project root (same level as this `README.md`)

- index.html
- main.css
- main.js


## How the heck am I supposed to do that?

- Fork this repository
- `git clone` your fork down to your local machine
- Fix the typos. Commit w/ message (`git add README.md && git commit -v`)
- Add the files. Commit w/ message (`git add . && git commit -v`)
- Push to your remote `git push`
- Submit a Pull Request to the original SUWDC repository

*Don't worry, we'll worry about branching, merging, and all that other fun stuff all in due time ;)*
